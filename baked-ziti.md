## Baked Ziti

### Ingredients

- 2 lbs. Ziti (uncooked)
- 2 lbs. Ricotta Cheese
- 3 Oz. Grated Romano Cheese
- 3 Cups Garlic & Onion Tomato Sauce (any brand will do)
- ½ Teas. Black Pepper
- 1 ½ lbs. Shredded Mozzarella Cheese

### Instructions

1. Cook Ziti according to package directions; 12 to 14 minutes until al dente, stirring often. After cooking, drain ziti well, but *DO NOT RINSE OFF UNDER WATER*!

2. While Ziti is cooking preheat oven to 350°F. Combine ricotta, romano, tomato sauce (reserve ¼ cup) and pepper in large mixing bowl.

3. Gently combine cooked ziti with cheese/sauce mixture. In a 13" x 9" x 2" pan, spread the ¼ cup reserved sauce. Add ziti and top with mozzarella cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and bake until mozzarella is thoroughly melted (about 12-15 minutes). Serve with garlic bread and additional sauce if desired.
