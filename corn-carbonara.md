## 20 Minute Corn Carbonara

### Ingredients

- 16 ounce spaghetti
- 8 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into small chunks
- 4 ears of corn, kernels removed
- ½ cup half and half or heavy cream
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¾ cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more to serve
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
- ¼ cup finely chopped chives
- Fresh basil leaves, to serve

### Instructions

1. Generously salt a large pot of water and bring to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente. Drain.

2. While the spaghetti cooks, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.

3. Pour all but about 3 tablespoons worth of bacon fat from the pan. Return pan with the reserved bacon grease to medium heat. Add in the corn and garlic and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer half of the corn mixture to a blender, keeping the rest in the pan for later. Add the half and half to the blender, Process until smooth.

4. Add the hot pasta and the corn sauce to the skillet and toss together along with the parmesan cheese. Heat over medium-low heat to warm through. Season with the red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper to taste, and sprinkle in the fresh chives and bacon.

5. Serve warm with additional parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil.
