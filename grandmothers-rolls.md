## Grandmother's Rolls

### Ingredients

- 1 quart milk
- 1 cup vegetable shortening
- 1 package yeast (¼ oz)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 3 cups sifted flour (plus another 4 ½ cups flour, separate from the 3 cups)
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 heaping tsp baking powder
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 cup sugar
- liquid vegetable oil (for coating cookware)

### Instructions

1. Melt 1 cup shortening
2. Heat milk but not to boiling. Allow to reach same temperature as shortening.
3. Combined the milk and shortening.
4. Dissolve yeast in ¼ cup warm water with 1 tsp sugar. Let rise 10 minutes.
5. Add yeast mixture to milk and shortening mixture.
6. Sift 3 cups of flour into the yeast-milk-shortening mixture.
7. Cover with a wet towel and let rise in a warm place for 2 hours.
8. When the dough is ready, mix together 1 tbsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 heaping tsp baking powder, and 1 cup of sugar, and add to the dough.
9. Work in the remaining 4 ½ cups of flour. The dough should still be quite sticky.
10. Cover the dough with a wet dish towel and let it rest in the refridgerator overnight.
11. When ready to use the dough, punch it down and take out the required amount. Place it on a well-floured surface. Sprinkle the top generously with flour.
12. Use a 2.5- to 3-inch diameter biscuit cutter (or a tomato paste can left over from the Great War, if you have one) to punch out each roll.
13. Use liquid vegetable oil to coat the pan. Place rolls in the pan and turn to coat with oil.
14. Let rolls rise in a warm place for 2 hours, but do not let them rise all the way to the top (they will fall flat during the bake if you do).
15. Bake at 400°F for 10-15 minutes on 2nd rack up from the bottom of the oven (or any rack if you're using convection).
